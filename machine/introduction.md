What is AI
- Four different perspectives

Thinking like a Person: Cognitive Science
- Information-processing psychology replaced by prevailing orthodoxy of behaviorism
    - Lead to development of field of Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience
    - Fields developed in parallel with AI
Acting Rationally
- Rational behavior: doing the right thing
- The right thing: maximally achieving pre-defined goals
- Reflex: Blinking is rational but does not involve thinking
- We'll use the term rational in a very specific, technical way;
    - Rationality concerns what decisions are made (not the thought process behind them)
    - Goals are expressed in terms of the utility of outcomes
    - Being rational means maximizing you expected utility
    - A better tile for this course would be: Computational Rationality
