# Data Encryption Standard (DES) History
- IBM developed Lucifer cipher in 1971
    - By team led by Feistel in late 60's
    - Used 64-bit data block with 128-bit key
    - Redeveloped as a commercial 56-bit key cipher (to be used on a chip) with input from NSA and others
- In 1973 NBS (now NIST) requested for proposals
- IBM submitted their revised Lucifer which was eventually accepted as the DES in 1977

# DES Design Controversy
- Although DES standard is public
- Considerable controversy over design
    - Choice of 56-bit key (vs Lucifer 128-bit)
    - Design Criteria (S-boxes) were classified
- Subsequent events and public analysis show in fact design was appropriate
- Use of DES has flourished
    - Still used in legacy applications
