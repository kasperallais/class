# Building Cryptographic Systems Video Notes
- Cryptography broadly applied gives the NSA trouble
- Cryptography forces the attacker to have a priorities list
- Cryptography doesn't actually provide any security
- Trusting the cryptography is trusting the mathematics
- When agencies break cryptography, they don't break the mathematics. They break the implementation, software, or something else
- Complexity is the worst enemy of security
- The more vulnerabilities you'll have
- The simpler we can make systems, the more secure they are
- NIST build standards around as much as possible
- AES is their standard crypto algorithm
- There's a lot that you can't standardize
- Security needs as few options as possible
- The only way you learn to make things is by breaking them
- Security is inherently adversarial
