# Symmetric Encryption
- Or conventional / secret-key / single-key
- Sender and recipient share a common key
- All classical encryption algorithms are secret-key
- Was the only type prior to invention of public-key in 1970s
- And by far the most widely used
# Some Basic Terminology
- Plaintext - original message
- Ciphertext - Coded message
- Cipher - Algorithm for transforming plaintext to ciphertext
- Key - Info used in cipher known only to sender/receiver
- Encipher (encrypt) - Converting plaintext to ciphertext
- Decipher (decrypt) - Recovering ciphertext from plaintext
- Cryptography - Study of encryption principles / methods
- Cryptanalysis (codebreaking) - Study of principles / methods of deciphering ciphertext without knowing key
- Cryptology - Field of both cryptography and cryptanalysis
