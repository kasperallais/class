# Roadmap
- Cryptographic algorithms
    - Symmetric ciphers, Asymmetric ciphers
- Cryptographic Data Integrity Algorithms
    - Hash Functions, Message Authentication Codes, Digital Signatures
- Mutual Trust
    - Key management and distribution, user authentication protocols
- Network/Internet Security, System Security
# Standards Organizations
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
- Internet Society (ISOC): Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB) - Requests for Comments (RFCs)
- International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
# Computer Security
- The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications)
# Key Objectives of Computer Security
- Confidentiality
    - Data confidentiality: Assures that private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals
    - Privacy: Assures that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed
- Integrity
    - Data integrity: Assures that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner
    - System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system
- Availability
    - Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users
# Additional Concepts
- Authenticity: The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator
- Accountability: The security goal that generates the requirements for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity
# Levels of Impact from Security Breaches
- Low: The loss could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals
- Moderate: The loss could be expected to have serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals
- High: The loss could be expected to have sever or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals
# Computer Security Challenges
- Not simple
- Must consider potential attacks
- Procedures used counter-intuitive
- Involve algorithms and secret info
- Must decide where to deploy mechanisms
- Battle of wits between attacker / admin
- Not perceived benefits until fail
- Requires regular monitoring
- Too often an after-thought in system design
- Regarded as impediment to using system
