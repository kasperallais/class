Authentication Protocols
- Many different authentication protocols are used in networking to verify the identity of devices and users
- Those protocols are essential because they provide a secure and standardized way of verifying the identity of users, devices, and other entities in a network
- Without authentication protocols, it would be difficult to securely and reliably identify entities in a network, making it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access and potentially compromise the network
- Authentication protocols also provide a means for securely exchanging information between entities in a network which we will discuss briefly
- This is important for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive dat aand preventing unauthorized access and other security threats
- Here are some of the most commonly used protocols
    - Kerberos - Key Distribution Center (KDC) based authentication protocol that uses tickets in domain environments
    - SRP - This is a password-based authentication protocol that uses cryptography to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks
    - SSL - A cryptographic protocol used for secure communication over a network network
    - TLS - TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides communication security over the internet. It is the successor to SSL
    - OAuth - An open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party access to their web resources without sharing their passwords
    - OpenID - OpenID is a decentralized authentication protocl that allows users to use a single identity to sign in to multiple websites
    - SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language is an XML-based standard for securely exchanging authentication and authorizaiton between parties
    - 2FA - An authentication method that uses a combination of two different factors to verify a user's identity.
    - FIDO - The Fast IDentity Online Alliance is a consortium of companies working to develop open standards for strong authentication
    - PKI -	PKI is a system for securely exchanging information based on the use of public and private keys for encryption and digital signatures.
