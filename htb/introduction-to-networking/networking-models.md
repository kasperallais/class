Networking Models
- Two networking models describe the communication and transfer of data from one host to another, called the ISO/OSI model and the TCP/IP model
- This is a simplified representation of the so-called layers representing transferred Bits in readable contents for us
The OSI Model 
- The OSI model is a reference model that can be used to describe and define the communication between systems. The reference model has seven individual layers
- The term OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection model
The TCP/IP Model
- TCP/IP is a generic term for many network protocols
- The protocols are responsible for the switching and transport of data packets on the internet
- The Internet is entirely based on the TCP/IP protocol family
ISO/OSI vs. TCP/IP
- TCP/IP is a communication protocol that allows hosts to connect to the Internet
- It refers to the Transmission Control Protocol used in and by applications on the Internet
- OSI is a communication gateway between the network and end-users
- The OSI model is usually referred to as the reference model because it is newer and more widely used
Packet Transfers
- In a layered system, devices in a layer exchange data in a different format called a protocol data unit (PDU)
- During the transmission, each layers adds a header to the PDU from the upper layer, which controls and identifies the packet
- This process is called encapsulation
- The header and the data together form the PDU for the next layer
- This process continues to the Physical Layer and Network Layer, where the data is transmitted to the receiver
- The receiver reverses the process and unpacks the data on each layer with the header information
