Network Types
- Each network is structured differently and can be set up individually
- For this reason, so called types and topologies have been developed that can be use to categorize these networks
Common Terminology
- Wide Area Network (WAN) - Internet
- Local Area Network (LAN) - Internal Networks
- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) - Internal Networks accessible over Wi-Fi
- Virtual Private Network - Connects multiple network sites to one LAN
WAN
- The WAN is commonly referred to as the internet
- When dealing with networking equipment, we'll often have a WAN Address and LAN Address
LAN / WLAN
- LANs and WLANs will typically assign IP Addresses designated for local use
- There's nothing different between a LAN and WLAN, other than WLAN's introduce the ability to transmit data without cables
VPN
- There are three main types of Virtual Private Networks, but all three have the same goal of making the user feel as if they were plugged into a different network
Site-To-Site VPN
- Both the client and server are Network Devices, typically either Routers or Firewalls, and share entire network ranges
Remote Access VPN 
- This involves the client's computer creating a virtual interface that behaves as if it is on a client's network
- If the VPN only creates routes for specific networks, this is called a Split-Tunnel VPN, meaning the Internet connection is not going out of the VPN
- For a company, split-tunnel VPN's are typically not idea because if the machine is infected with malware, network-based detection methods will most likely not work as that traffic goes out of the Internet
SSL VPN
- VPN that is done within our web browser and is becoming increasingly common as web browsers are becoming capable of doing anything
Book Terms
- Global Area Network (GAN) - Global Network (the Internet)
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - Regional Network (multiple LANs)
- Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) - Personal Network (bluetooth)
GAN
- A worldwide network such as the internet is known as a GAN 
- Internationally active companies also maintain isolated networks that span several WANs and connect company computers worldwide
- GANs use the glass fibers infrastructure of wide-area networks and interconnect them by international undersea cables or satellite transmission
MAN
- Man is a broadband telecommunications network that connects several LANs in a geographical proximity
- As a rule, these are individual branches of a company connected to a MAN via leased lines
- High-performance routers and high-performance connections based on glass fibers are used, which enable a significantly higher data throughput than the Internet
- The transmission speed between two remote nodes is comparable to communication within a LAN
PAN / WPAN
- Modern devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, or desktop computers can be connected ad hoc to form a network to enable data exchange. This can be done by cable in the form of a Personal Area Network (PAN)
- The wireless variant Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) is based on Bluetooth or Wireless USB technologies
- A WPAN that is established via Bluetooth is called Piconet
- PANs and WPANs usually only extent only a few meters and are therefore not suitable for connecting devices in separate rooms or even buildings
- In the context of IOT, WPANs are used to communicate control and monitor applications with low data rates
