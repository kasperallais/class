Networking Topologies
- A network topology is a typical arrangements and physical or logical connection of devices in a network
- Computers are hosts, such as clients and servers, that actively use the network
- They also include network components such as switches, bridges, and routers
- The network topology determines the components to be used and the access methods to the transmission media
- The transmission medium layout used to connect devices is the physical topology of the network
- In contrast, the logical topology is how the signals act on the network media or how the data will be transmitted across the network from one device to the devices' physical connection
Connections
- Coaxial cabling - Wi-Fi
- Glass fiber cabling - Cellular
- Twisted-pair cabling - Satellite
- Network nodes are the transmission medium's connection points to transmitters and receiver of electrical, optical, or radio signals in the medium
- A node may be connected to a computer, but certain types may have only one microcontroller on a node or may have no programmable device at all
Classifications
- We can imagine a topology as a virtual form or structure of a network
- Network topologies are divided into the following eight basic types
    - Point-to-Point
    - Bus
    - Star
    - Ring
    - Mesh 
    - Tree
    - Hybrid
    - Daisy Chain
Point-to-Point
- Direct and straightforward physical link exists only between two hosts
- These two devices can use these connections for mutual communication
- Point-to-Point topologies are the basic model of traditional telephony and must not be confused with P2P
Bus
- All hosts are connected via a transmission medium in the bus topology
- Every host has access to the transmission medium and the signals that are transmitted over it
- There is no central network component that controls the processes on it
- The transmission medium for this can be, for example, a coaxial cable
- Since the medium is shared with all the others, only one host can send, and all the others can only receive and evaluate the data and see whether it is intended for itself
Star
- The star topology is a network component that maintains a connection to all hosts
- Each host is connected to the central network component via a separate link
- This is usually a router, a hub, or a switch
- These handle the forwarding function for the data packets
- The data traffic on the central network component can be very high since all data and connections go through it
Ring
- The physical ring topology is such that each host or node is connected to the ring with two cables:
    - One for the incoming signals
    - Another for the outgoing ones
- The ring topology typically does not require an active network component
- The control and access to the transmission medium are regulated by a protocol to which all stations adhere
- A logical ring topology is based on a physical start topology, where a distributor at the node simulates the ring by forwarding from one port to the next
- The information is transmitted in a predetermined transmission direction
- Typically, the transmission medium is accessed sequentially from station to station using a retrieval system from the central station or a token
- A token is a bit patterns that continually passes through a ring network in one direction, which works according to the claim token process
Mesh
- Many nodes decide about the connections on a physical level and the routing on a logical level in meshed networks
- There are two basic structures from the basic concept: the fully meshed and the partially meshed structure
- Each host is connected to every other host in the network in a fully meshed structure
- That means that the hosts are meshed with each other
- This technique is primarily used in WAN or MAN to ensure high reliability and bandwidth
- Each node of a fully meshed topology has the same routing functions and knows the neighboring nodes it can communicate with proximity to the network gateway and traffic loads
- In the partially meshed structure, the endpoints are connected by only one connection
- In this type of network topology, specific nodes are connected to exactly one other node, and some other nodes are connected to two or more other nodes with a point-to-point connection
Tree
- The tree topology is an extended star topology that more extensive local networks have in this structure
- This topology is often used in larger company buildings
- There are both logical tree structures according to the spanning tree and physical ones
- Modular modern networks, based on structured cabling with a hub hierarchy, also have a tree structure
- Tree topologies are also used for broadband networks and city networks
Hybrid
- Hybrid networks combine two or more topologies so that the resulting network does not present any standard topologies
- A hybrid topology is always created when two different basic network topologies are interconnected
Daisy Chain
- Multiple hosts are connected by placing a cable from one node to another
- Since this creates a chain of connections, it is also known as a daisy-chain configuration in which multiple hardware components are connected in a series
