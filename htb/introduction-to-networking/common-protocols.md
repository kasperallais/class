Common Protocols
- Internet protocols are standardized rules and guidelines defined in RFCs that specify how devices on a network should communicate with each other
- They ensure that devices on a network can exchange information consistently and reliably, regardless of the hardware and software used
- For devices to communicate on a network, they need to be connected through a communication channel, such as wired or wireless connection
- The devices then exchange information using a set of standardized protocols that define the format and structure of the data being transmitted
- The two main types of connections used on networks are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
