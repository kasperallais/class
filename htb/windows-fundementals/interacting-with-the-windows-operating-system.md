- Graphical User Interface
    - Introduced in the late 1970s by the Xerox Palo Alto research laboratory
    - Added to Apple and Microsoft operating systems to address usability concerns for everyday users that would likely have difficulty navigating the command line
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
    - RDP is a proprietary Microsoft protocol which allows a user to connect to a remote system over a network connection and obtain a graphical user interface
    - The user connects using RDP client software
    - RDP uses port 3389 to open a dedicated network channel for sending data back and forth. When connecting via RDP, a user can access the GUI as if they were actually sitting at the computer and logging into it locally.
- Windows Command Line
    - Can be leveraged to introduce automation to perform certain tasks quickly
    - Two main ways to interact with the system from the command line:
        - Command Prompt (CMD)
        - PowerShell
- CMD
    - The Command prompt can be opened from the Start Menu, by typing cmd in the run dialogue box, or by directly launching the binary from C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe
    - For more information about a command, we can use 'help <command name>'
    - Certain commands have their own help menus, which can be accessed by typing<command> /?.
- PowerShell
    - Command shell that was designed by Microsoft to be more geared towards system administrators
    - PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Framework, which is used for building and running applications on Windows.
- Cmdlets
    - Small single-function tolls built into the shell
    - Cmdlets are in the form of Verb-Noun
- Aliases
    - Many cmdlets have aliases
    - For example, the aliases for the cmdlet Set-Location, to change directories, is either cd or sl
    - We can view all available aliases by typing Get-Alias
Running Scripts
- The PowerShell ISE allows users to write PowerShell scripts on the fly
Execution Policy
- Sometimes we will find that we are unable to run scripts on a system
- This is due to a security feature called the execution policy, which attempts to prevent the execution of malicious scripts
