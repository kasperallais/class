# The Analysis Process
- Network Traffic Analysis is a dynamic process that can change depending on the tools we have on hand, permissions given to us by the organization, and our network's visibility
- Traffic Analysis is a detailed examination of an event or process, determining its origin and impact, which can be used to trigger specific precautions and/or actions to support or prevent future occurrences
- With network traffic, this means breaking down the data into understandable chunks, examining it for anything that deviates from regular network traffic, for potentially malicious traffic such as unauthorized remote communications from the internet over RDP, SSH, or Telnet, or unique instances preceding network issues
- Traffic Analysis is a highly versatile and essential tool to have in our defensive toolbox
- Without the ability to monitor traffic, we are working with a massive piece of the puzzle missing
- Analytics on network usage, top-talking hosts and servers, and internal communications are all crucial pieces that provide us, the administrators and defenders, a way to see and correct issues before or soon after they happen

# Analysis Dependencies
- Traffic capturing and analysis can be performed in two different ways, active or passive
- With passive, we are just copying data that we can see without directly interacting with the packets
- For active traffic capture and analysis, the needs are a bit different
- Active capture requires us to take a more hands-on approach
- This process can also be referred to as in-line traffic captures
