# Descriptive Analysis
- Descriptive analysis is an essential step in any data analysis
- It serves to describe a data set based on individual characteristics
1. What is the issue
    - Suspected breach? Networking Issue?
2. Define our scope and goal
    - Target: Multiple hosts potentially downloading a malicious file from bad.example.com
    - When: Within the last 48 hours + 2 hours from now
    - Supporting Info: Filenames/types 'superbad.exe' 'new-crypto-miner.exe'
3 Define our target(s)
    - Scope: 192.168.100.0/24 network, protocls used were HTTP and FTP

# Diagnostic Analysis
- Diagnostic analysis clarifies the causes, effects, and iteractions of conditions
- In doing so, it provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation
4. Capture network traffic
5. Identification of required network traffic components (filtering)
6. An understanding of captured network traffic

# Predictive Analysis
- By evalauting historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future possibilities
- Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic anaylses, this method of data analysis makes it possible to identify trends, detect deviations from espected values at an early stage, and predict future occurrences as accurately as possible
