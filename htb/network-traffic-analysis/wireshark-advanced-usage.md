# Plugins
- The analyze and statistics radials provide a plethora of plugins to run against the capture

# The Statistics and Analyze Tabs
- The Statistics and Analyze table can provide us with great insight into the data we are are examining

# Following TCP Streams
- Wireshark can stitch TCP packets back together to recreate the entire stream in a readable format
- This ability also allows us to pull data out of the capture
- This works for almost any protocol that uses TCP as a transport mechanism

# Extracting Data and Files from a Capture
- Wireshark can recover many different types of data from streams
- It requires you to have captured the entire conversation
- Otherwise, this ability will fail to put an incomplete datagram back together
