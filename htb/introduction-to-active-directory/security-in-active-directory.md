## Security in Active Directory

# General AD Hardening Measures
- the Microsoft LAPS is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement

# LAPS
- Accounts can be set up to have their password rotated on a fixed interval
- This free tool can be beneficial in reducing the impact of an individual compromised host in an AD environment

# Audit Policy Settings
- Effective logging and monitoring can be sued to detect an attacker or unauthorized employee adding a user or computer or other

# Group Policy Security Settings
- GPOs are virtual collections of policy settings that can be applied to specific users, groups, and computers at the OU level

# Update Management
- Proper patch management is critical for any organization
- The Windows Server Update Service can be installed as a role on a Windows Server and can be used to minimize the manual task of patching a Windows system

# Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)
- A gMSA is an account managed by the domain that offers a higher level of security than other types of service accounts for use with non-interactive applications
- They provide automatic password management with a 120 character password generated by the domain controller

# Security Groups
- Security Groups offer an easy way to assign access to network resources
- AD automatically creates some default security groups by default

# Account Separation
- Administrators must have two separate accounts

# Password Complexity Policies + Passphrases + 2FA
- Ideally, an organization should be using passphrases or large randomly generated passwords using an enterprise password manager

# Limiting Domain Admin Account Usage
- Domain admin accounts should only be used to log in to Domain Controllers, not personal workstations, jump hosts, web servers, etc.

# Periodically Auditing and Removing Stale Users and Objects
- Periodically audit AD and remove or disable unused accounts

# Aduting Permission and Access
- Perform access control audits to ensure that users only have the level of access required for their day-to-day work

# Audit Policies & Logging
- Visibilty into the domain is a must

# Using Restricted Groups
- Restricted Groups allow for adminstrators to configure group membership via Group Policy

# Limiting Server Roles
- It is important not to install additional roles on sensitive hosts
- Increases attack surface
