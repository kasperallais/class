# Active Directory Structure
- AD is a directory service for Windows network environments
- It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices and file share, group policies, servers and workstations, and trusts
- AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment
- A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services gives an organization ways to store directory data and make it available to both standard users and administrators on the same network
- AD DS stores information such as usernames and passwords and managed the rights needed for authorized users to access the information
- It is designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably "not secure by default"
- Active Directory flaws and misconfigurations can often be used to obtain a foothold, move latterally and vertically within a network, and gain unauthorized access to proteced resources such as databases, file shares, source code, and more
