What is a Computer Network?
- A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources
Types of nodes
- Router
- Switch
- Firewall
    - Software Firewall
    - Hardware Firewall
- Server
- Client
Building a Network
- Two PCs connected together make a network
Clients
- A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server
Server
- A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients
- The same device can be a client in some situations and server in other situations
Switches
- Switches are used to forward traffic within a LAN (Local Area Network)
- These switches cannot connect directly to the internet
- They cannot send data between the two LANs
- Have many network interfaces for end hosts to connect to
- Provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
- Do not provide connectivity between LANs/over the internet
Routers
- Have fewer network interfaces than switches
- Are used to provide connectivity between LANs
- Are therefore used to send data over the internet
Firewalls
- Monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules
- Can be placed 'inside' the network or 'outside' the network
- Are known as 'Next-Generation Firewalls' when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities
- Network firewalls are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks
- Host based firewalls are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.
