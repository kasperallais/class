- There are two separate configuration files kept on the device at once
- running-config = the current, active configuration file on the device. As you enter commands in the [[cli]], you edit the active config
- startup-config = the configuration file that will be loaded upon restart of the device.
- To show running / startup config use 'show running-config' or 'show startup-config'
