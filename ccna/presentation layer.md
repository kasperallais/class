- Layer 6 of the [[osi model]]
- Data in the [[application layer]] is in 'application format'
- It needs to be 'translated' to a different format to be sent over the network.
- The presentation layer's job is to translate between application and [[network]] format
- For example, encryption of data as it is sent, and decryption of data as it is received
- Also translates ebtween different [[application layer]] formats
